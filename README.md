# Welcome to the shutorial

This is the SHell Tutorial, an exerciser teaching the use of the shell
console, in practice. You will be given a set of assignments to be
solved in a chroot (a sort of light virtual machine providing a
dedicated environment). Each assignment consists in a specific
environment setup in the chroot, a webpage presenting the assignment,
and a machinery to check your success in solving the assignment. 

Please proceed to the [v2](v2) directory for more information on the
modern version of this tool.
